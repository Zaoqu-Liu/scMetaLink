# Compute Spatial Communication

Calculate spatially-weighted metabolite-mediated communication. This
function incorporates spatial distance between spots to weight
communication strength.

## Usage

``` r
computeSpatialCommunication(
  object,
  method = "knn",
  k_neighbors = 6,
  symmetric = TRUE,
  distance_threshold = 150,
  sigma = 50,
  lambda = 50,
  comm_method = "geometric",
  min_production = 0.1,
  min_sensing = 0.1,
  analysis_level = "region",
  n_permutations = 1000,
  n_cores = 1,
  seed = 42,
  verbose = TRUE
)
```

## Arguments

- object:

  A scMetaLink object with spatial information and production/sensing
  scores

- method:

  Character. Spatial weighting method:

  - "knn": K-nearest neighbors only (recommended for Visium, most honest
    given the resolution limitations)

  - "gaussian": Gaussian decay exp(-d^2/2\*sigma^2)

  - "exponential": Exponential decay exp(-d/lambda)

  - "linear": Linear decay max(0, 1 - d/d_max)

  - "threshold": Binary cutoff (1 if d \<= threshold, 0 otherwise)

- k_neighbors:

  Integer. Number of nearest neighbors for knn method. Default: 6. For
  Visium hexagonal grid, 6 corresponds to immediate neighbors.
  \*\*Note\*\*: The weight matrix is symmetrized, so actual neighbor
  count per spot may exceed k (typically k to 2k).

- symmetric:

  Logical. Whether to symmetrize the KNN weight matrix (default: TRUE).
  If TRUE, when spot A is a neighbor of B, B is also considered a
  neighbor of A. This ensures bidirectional communication potential.

- distance_threshold:

  Numeric. Maximum distance for communication in micrometers. Spot pairs
  beyond this distance are considered non-interacting. Default: 150 um.
  Note: Most metabolites have effective diffusion ranges of 10-200 um in
  tissue. For Visium data (100 um spot spacing), values \>200 um are
  rarely meaningful.

- sigma:

  Numeric. Sigma parameter for Gaussian decay (in um). Default: 50 um.
  Represents the characteristic decay distance. Literature suggests:

  - Fast-turnover metabolites (adenosine, ATP): 20-30 um

  - Medium-range metabolites (lactate): 50-80 um

  - Stable metabolites (amino acids): 80-120 um

- lambda:

  Numeric. Lambda parameter for exponential decay (in um). Default: 50
  um.

- comm_method:

  Character. Communication score method: "geometric", "product",
  "harmonic"

- min_production:

  Numeric. Minimum production score threshold (0-1). Cell types with
  production score below this are considered non-producers.

- min_sensing:

  Numeric. Minimum sensing score threshold (0-1). Cell types with
  sensing score below this are considered non-sensors.

- analysis_level:

  Character. Level of analysis:

  - "region": Aggregate by cell type (default, recommended). Uses the
    full inferProduction/inferSensing logic.

  - "spot": Compute spot-to-spot communication. \*\*WARNING\*\*: This is
    a simplified implementation for exploratory analysis. It does NOT
    include: degradation adjustment, secretion weighting, Hill
    transformation, or full normalization. Use for hotspot
    identification only.

- n_permutations:

  Integer. Number of permutations for significance testing.
  Default: 1000. For publication, recommend \>= 1000 permutations. The
  permutation test shuffles cell type labels while preserving spatial
  structure, then \*\*recalculates production and sensing scores\*\*
  from scratch (consistent with non-spatial version), which is the
  scientifically correct null model for testing whether communication
  patterns are associated with cell type identity.

- n_cores:

  Integer. Number of cores for parallel computing

- seed:

  Integer. Random seed for reproducibility

- verbose:

  Logical. Print progress messages

## Value

Updated scMetaLink object with spatial_communication slot

## Details

\*\*Important Notes on Spatial Resolution:\*\*

For Visium data (55 um spots, ~100 um spacing), each spot contains 1-10
cells. This means:

- Cell type annotations should ideally come from deconvolution methods
  (e.g., RCTD, cell2location, SPOTlight)

- The "knn" method (k=6) is recommended as it only considers immediate
  neighbors, which is most honest given the resolution limitations

- Distance-weighted methods (gaussian, exponential) may provide "false
  precision" when spot spacing is similar to metabolite diffusion
  distance

\*\*Permutation Test Design:\*\*

The permutation test shuffles cell type labels (not spatial positions)
and \*\*recalculates production/sensing scores from expression data\*\*.
This is consistent with the non-spatial version and tests whether the
observed communication pattern is associated with cell type identity
beyond what would be expected by chance.

\*\*Spatial communication is modeled as:\*\* \$\$C\_{spatial}(i -\> j,
m) = MPP(m, i) \* MSC(m, j) \* w(d\_{ij})\$\$

where w(d) is the spatial weight function:

- Gaussian: w(d) = exp(-d^2 / 2\*sigma^2)

- Exponential: w(d) = exp(-d / lambda)

- Linear: w(d) = max(0, 1 - d/d_max)

- Threshold: w(d) = I(d \<= d_threshold)
