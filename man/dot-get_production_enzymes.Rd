\description{
Extract enzymes and secretion transporters involved in metabolite
  production and release. This function filters for proteins that contribute to
  making metabolites available for intercellular communication.
}
\details{
The production potential consists of two components:
\itemize{
  \item Synthesis enzymes: Proteins that catalyze metabolite biosynthesis
  \item Secretion transporters: Membrane transporters that release metabolites
    to the extracellular space (transport_direction = "out")
}

Uptake transporters (transport_direction = "in") are excluded from production
as they represent metabolite sensing/uptake rather than production/release.
