\usage{
computeCommunication(
  object,
  method = "geometric",
  min_production = 0.1,
  min_sensing = 0.1,
  population.size = FALSE,
  n_permutations = 100,
  n_cores = 1,
  seed = 42,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A scMetaLink object with production and sensing scores}

\item{method}{Character. Communication score method: "geometric" (default), "product", "harmonic"}

\item{min_production}{Numeric. Minimum production score threshold (0-1)}

\item{min_sensing}{Numeric. Minimum sensing score threshold (0-1)}

\item{population.size}{Logical. Whether to weight communication by cell type
population sizes. When TRUE, communication strength is scaled by the relative
abundance of sender and receiver cell types, reflecting the biological reality
that larger populations contribute more to overall tissue signaling.}

\item{n_permutations}{Integer. Number of permutations for significance testing (0 to skip)}

\item{n_cores}{Integer. Number of cores for parallel computing}

\item{seed}{Integer. Random seed for reproducibility}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages}
}
\value{
Updated scMetaLink object with communication_scores and p-values
}
\description{
Calculate communication scores between all cell type pairs
  mediated by metabolites. Communication strength represents the potential
  for signal transmission from sender to receiver cells via metabolites.
}
\details{
The communication score combines production and sensing capabilities:
\itemize{
  \item geometric: sqrt(production * sensing) - balanced measure
  \item product: production * sensing - emphasizes strong bilateral signals
  \item harmonic: 2*production*sensing/(production+sensing) - penalizes imbalance
}

When \code{population.size = TRUE}, scores are multiplied by:
sqrt(n_sender/n_total * n_receiver/n_total), which accounts for the
relative contribution of each cell type to tissue-level communication.
