\title{Aggregate Communication by Pathway}
\usage{
aggregateByPathway(object, top_pathways = 50, min_metabolites = 3)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A scMetaLink object with significant interactions}

\item{top_pathways}{Integer. Number of top pathways to analyze (default: 50)}

\item{min_metabolites}{Integer. Minimum metabolites per pathway (default: 3)}
}
\value{
Updated scMetaLink object with pathway_aggregated slot filled
}
\description{
Aggregate metabolite-mediated communication at the pathway level.
  Due to the large number of pathway associations, this function uses a
  simplified approach focusing on top pathways.
