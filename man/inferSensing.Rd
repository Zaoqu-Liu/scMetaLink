\arguments{
\item{object}{A scMetaLink object}

\item{method}{Character. Scoring method: "mean", "proportion", or "combined"}

\item{mean_method}{Character. Method for calculating mean expression:
"arithmetic" (standard mean) or "trimean" (more robust to outliers and dropout).}

\item{min_expression}{Numeric. Minimum expression threshold}

\item{min_pct}{Numeric. Minimum percentage of expressing cells (0-1)}

\item{weight_by_affinity}{Logical. Weight by receptor-metabolite affinity score}

\item{include_transporters}{Logical. Include uptake transporters in sensing}

\item{use_hill}{Logical. Apply Hill function transformation to model receptor
binding saturation kinetics. When TRUE, high expression levels show diminishing
returns, reflecting biological receptor saturation.}

\item{hill_n}{Numeric. Hill coefficient (cooperativity). Default 1 (no cooperativity).
Values > 1 indicate positive cooperativity.}

\item{hill_Kh}{Numeric. Half-maximal response threshold (0-1 scale after normalization).
Default 0.5. Lower values mean saturation occurs at lower expression levels.}

\item{normalize}{Logical. Normalize scores across cell types}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages}
}
\value{
Updated scMetaLink object with sensing_scores slot filled
}
\description{
Infer metabolite sensing capability for each cell type based on
  receptor and transporter expression. Sensing capability reflects a cell type's
  capacity to detect and respond to extracellular metabolites.
}
\details{
The Hill function transformation models receptor-ligand binding dynamics:
\deqn{P = \frac{E^n}{K_h^n + E^n}}
where E is expression, n is the Hill coefficient, and Kh is the half-maximal
threshold. This reflects the biological reality that receptor signaling
saturates at high ligand/receptor concentrations.
