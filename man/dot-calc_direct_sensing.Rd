\title{Calculate Direct Lactate Sensing Score (HCAR1)}
\usage{
.calc_direct_sensing(
  gene_scores,
  gene_sets,
  include_uptake = TRUE,
  uptake_weight = 0.5
)
}
\arguments{
\item{gene_scores}{Matrix of gene scores (genes x cell_types)}

\item{gene_sets}{Lactate gene sets from .get_lactate_gene_sets()}

\item{include_uptake}{Logical. Include MCT uptake transporters}

\item{uptake_weight}{Numeric. Weight for uptake contribution (default 0.5)}
}
\value{
Named numeric vector of direct sensing scores per cell type
}
\description{
Calculates direct lactate sensing capability based on HCAR1 expression,
optionally weighted by uptake transporter expression.

DirectSensing = HCAR1_expression + beta * mean(Uptake_transporters)
}
