\usage{
filterSignificantInteractions(
  object,
  pvalue_threshold = 0.05,
  adjust_method = "metabolite_stratified",
  min_score = 0
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{scMetaLink object}

\item{pvalue_threshold}{Numeric. P-value threshold (default: 0.05)}

\item{adjust_method}{Character. Multiple testing correction method: "BH", "bonferroni", 
"holm", "none", or "metabolite_stratified" (recommended, performs BH within each metabolite)}

\item{min_score}{Numeric. Minimum communication score (default: 0)}
}
\value{
Updated scMetaLink object
}
\description{
Filter Significant Interactions

\details{
The \code{adjust_method} parameter controls how p-values are corrected for multiple testing:
\itemize{
  \item "metabolite_stratified" (recommended): Performs BH correction within each metabolite,
    then combines results. This is less conservative than global correction and more
    biologically meaningful since metabolites are independent biological signals.
  \item "BH", "bonferroni", "holm": Standard global correction methods. Can be very
    conservative when testing many interactions.
  \item "none": No correction, uses raw p-values. Use with caution.
