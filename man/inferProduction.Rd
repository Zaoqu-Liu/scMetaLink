\usage{
inferProduction(
  object,
  method = "combined",
  mean_method = "arithmetic",
  min_expression = 0,
  min_pct = 0.1,
  consider_degradation = TRUE,
  consider_secretion = TRUE,
  normalize = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A scMetaLink object}

\item{method}{Character. Scoring method: "mean", "proportion", or "combined"}

\item{mean_method}{Character. Method for calculating mean expression:
"arithmetic" (standard mean) or "trimean" (more robust to outliers and dropout).
Trimean is recommended for single-cell data with high dropout rates.}

\item{min_expression}{Numeric. Minimum expression threshold}

\item{min_pct}{Numeric. Minimum percentage of expressing cells (0-1)}

\item{consider_degradation}{Logical. Subtract degradation enzyme expression}

\item{consider_secretion}{Logical. Weight by secretion potential}

\item{normalize}{Logical. Normalize scores across cell types}

\item{verbose}{Logical. Print progress messages}
}
\value{
Updated scMetaLink object with production_scores slot filled
}
\description{
Infer metabolite production potential for each cell type based on
  enzyme expression patterns. Production potential reflects a cell type's capacity
  to synthesize and secrete metabolites for intercellular communication.
