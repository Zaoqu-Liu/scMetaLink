\usage{
enrichPathways(
  object,
  pvalue_threshold = 0.05,
  min_overlap = 2,
  adjust_method = "BH"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{scMetaLink object with significant interactions}

\item{pvalue_threshold}{Numeric. P-value cutoff for enrichment (default: 0.05)}

\item{min_overlap}{Integer. Minimum overlap between significant metabolites and pathway (default: 2)}

\item{adjust_method}{Character. P-value adjustment method (default: "BH")}
}
\value{
data.frame with enriched pathways and statistics
}
\description{
Perform hypergeometric test to identify enriched pathways
  among significant metabolite-mediated interactions
}
\examples{
\donttest{
# Perform pathway enrichment
enriched <- enrichPathways(result)
head(enriched)
}
}
